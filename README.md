## RemotePythonClient
# *I can not stress this enough: only use this for educational purposes!*

A very simple client to interact with RemotePythonServer. All text written into stdin is sent to RemotePythonServer and is executed as Python code, as proof of concept.

Input your FTP details into *settings.py* and input the username of the person running RemotePythonServer as the first argument when running *main.py*.

That's all. Now you can remotely execute Python, which is dangerous depending on the circumstances. This is mostly a proof of concept. I, personally, do not endorse malicious use with this program, but I expect it, if someone ever finds it. I just do not want to be arrested, so there's that.
